%like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to carry out efficient inference. 
Our algorithm, while exact, also provides a framework for faster, approximate algorithms.
A priori, the number of rejected proposals preceeding any observation is 
%a random number that a priori 
unbounded: one can bound the computational cost of an iteration by limiting the maximum number
of rejected proposals. Similarly, one might share rejected proposals across observations. We leave
the study of such approximate sampling algorithms %resulting from such user impatience 
for future research. Also left open is a more careful analysis
of Markov mixing rates for the applications we considered. There are also a
 number of applications that we have
not described here: particularly relevant are rejection samplers for 
%stochastic differential
diffusions~\citep{beskos06,bladt2014} .
